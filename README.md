## How It Works

1. **User Interface**: Clean, responsive form where users can enter their name or select from previous users
2. **Data Collection**: Form collects name, item selected, and automatic timestamp
3. **Google Apps Script**: Handles POST requests and writes data to Google Sheets
4. **User List**: Automatically fetches and displays previous users for easy selection

## Customization

### Adding/Removing Items

Edit the `itemSelect` dropdown options in `index.html`:

```html
<option value="New Item">New Item</option>
```

### Styling

Modify the CSS section in `index.html` to match your lodge's branding.

### Sheet Configuration

If your Google Sheet has different column names or order, update the Apps Script accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Error logging item"**: Check that your Google Apps Script URL is correct
2. **"Sheet not found"**: Verify the SHEET_ID and SHEET_NAME in your Apps Script
3. **Users not loading**: Ensure your Google Sheet has data and the Apps Script is deployed correctly
